        <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth</h3>
        <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! i enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most gruelling-time of my life. Since completing the course. I've succesfully switched carrers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

     <h3 class="htga">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended</h3>
     <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former students of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, I've often reffered to it during inteciews as an example of my developent experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiveng multiple offers. 100% recommend!

     <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselvs. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy</h3>

The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from and incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
